           <h2 class="shib-heading">What is Shibboleth?</h2>
           <p>
             The Shibboleth System is a standards based, open source
             software package for web single sign-on across or within
             organizational boundaries. More information can be found on
             our 
             <a href="https://oit.ncsu.edu/campus-it/identity-management/shibboleth/" target="oit">Shibboleth at NC State page</a>.
           </p>

           <h2 class="shib-heading">Do Not Bookmark This Page</h2>
           <p>
             Shibboleth works by authenticating your Unity ID and
             password, and then redirecting you back to the service you
             came from. If you bookmark this page, Shibboleth won't know
             which service to send you back to, and will display an
             error.
           </p>
